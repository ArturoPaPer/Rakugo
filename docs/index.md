# Welcome to RakugoDocs

This is documentation of [Rakugo](https://github.com/jebedaia360/Rakugo) Project.

## About Rakugo:
Rakugo is framemork (inspired by [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org)) for story driven games in [Godot](https://godotengine.org)
or like my friend call it *Story Management Plugin*.

The idea is to have a ready to use plug-in for stories, so developers can create narrative driven games with all the amazing features and tools of Godot 3.1+.

## How to start:
You can download one of our templates:

- Phone Sim (WIP)
- 3D Walker (WIP)
- Visual Novel(WIP)

And then open it as godot project and [config it](config.md).
